\title{Calculate Vehicle Efficiency (mi/kWh)}
\usage{
efficiency(csv)
}
\arguments{
\item{csv}{A data frame containing a `Distance` column representing the
total distance traveled (in miles) and data required by `kWhUsed()`.}
}
\value{
The vehicle efficiency in miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh).
}
\description{
This function computes the vehicle's efficiency in miles per kilowatt-hour
(mi/kWh), based on the total distance traveled and energy consumed.
